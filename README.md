# EEG Signal Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying mental states (concentrated, relaxed, and neutral) using EEG recordings. Electroencephalography (EEG) records electrical activity in the brain using scalp electrodes, capturing real-time patterns of neuronal impulses and offering insights into brain function. Raw EEG data reflects cognitive processes, emotional states, and neurological conditions, providing a non-invasive means to link brain activity to behavioral and biological reactions. Machine learning models analyze EEG data, revealing patterns and abnormalities. These models enhance medical responses to neurological disorders through improved diagnostics and treatment planning. They also decode brain signals for controlling devices, and prosthetics, and aiding individuals with motor impairments.

### Dataset Overview
- Participants: 4
- Electrodes: 5
- EEG Sessions: 24

### Data Preprocessing
To extract meaningful insights from the EEG recordings, the dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:

##### Segmentation:
- Each EEG recording was split into 100 segments, allowing for a granular analysis of mental states.

##### Feature Extraction:
- Features such as minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation were extracted from each segment. Frequency information was obtained using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

### Models

##### K-NN Model
The initial model employed a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classification, achieving an accuracy of 43%. Further refinement and exploration were conducted based on the insights gained from this model.

###### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis revealed that the first two components are the most relevant in capturing variance within the dataset. This insight influenced subsequent model development.

##### XGBoost Model
The final model utilized XGBoost, incorporating the dimensionality reduction from PCA. This model yielded an accuracy of 70%, showcasing improvements over the initial K-NN model.

### Business Recommendations
The developed model has practical applications in the following areas:

##### Mental State Classification:
The model can effectively classify mental states, providing valuable insights into distinct brain activity patterns associated with concentration, relaxation, and neutrality.

##### Neuromotor Interfaces:
As a prototype, this model can pave the way for the development of neuromotor interfaces. These interfaces can interpret brain imaging data, facilitating advancements in brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics.

##### Collaboration with Biomedical Researchers:
Collaborate with biomedical researchers to leverage the model for neurological disorder studies, potentially advancing medical responses.

##### Personalized Experiences:
Explore applications in personalized experiences, tailoring interfaces or services based on real-time mental states inferred from EEG signals.

### Future Data Improvements
To enhance the model's capabilities, consider the following improvements:

Signal Strength Enhancement:
- Investigate signal amplification techniques or preprocessing methods to enhance the strength of EEG signals, potentially improving model sensitivity.

Expanded Electrode Coverage:
- Expand the dataset by incorporating data from a more extensive array of electrodes, providing a more comprehensive representation of brain activity.

### Future Model Improvements
To further advance the EEG classification model, consider exploring the following avenues for improvement:

Enhanced Feature Engineering:
- Explore additional feature engineering techniques to extract more nuanced information from EEG signals, potentially uncovering hidden patterns.

Advanced Model Architectures:
- Experiment with more complex model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or attention mechanisms, to capture temporal dependencies in EEG data more effectively.

These enhancements can contribute to the model's sophistication and broaden its capacity to interpret and classify EEG data accurately.

This project lays the foundation for leveraging EEG data to classify mental states. By addressing current limitations and exploring future improvements, there is substantial potential for enhancing the accuracy and applicability of the model.
